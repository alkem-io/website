# How to use Alkemio's collaboration tools?

As a Host, I want an easy way to ask my Community questions to make progress on the Challenges. Discussions with the Alkemio Community brought forward that users want to contribute in multiple ways: to growing the community, to framing challenges, to building up shared knowledge. This is now possible! Our selection of collaboration tools now offers you the ability to start collaborating directly in the context. Not in a separate document, or miro board, or spreadsheet, but directly in a Space where you have also gathered the community, the Challenges, and the knowledge base.

In this Support page, we will explain what **types** the platform offers, **where** you can use them, and how the use of our **templates** can help you.

### Collaboration tool types
To make progress on a set of Challenges, you need a way to share information with the community, gather knowledge or allow interaction between members. For each callout, question, or excercise, you may want to gather input in a different way. You may want short answers in a discussion, or more visual contributions in the form of a whiteboard. The platform offers you several collaboration tools, and will continue to expand these types, that you can use everywhere. The current set of tools are:

* **A Post** to start a discussion, send a message with information such as a guidance video, or to ask your community a question. Members are able to respond with short comments.
* **A Collection of posts** to gather information in a more structured way. As a lead you can choose to add some guiding questions or information fields that members have to fill in. Members are able to respond with a more extensive answer, including references, tags, and visuals. Also, other members can comment on the response of that member.
* **A Whiteboard** to allow members to contribute visually, for example to submit post-its to a stakeholder map or sketching the vision of a Challenge.    
* **A Collection of Whiteboards** to gather multiple responses in a more visual way. The lead can choose a template that members must fill in when submitting their answer, for example can everyone draw their vision for this Challenge.
* **A Collection of links** to gather materials in a set of links, for example relevant articles, blogposts, or guidance documents. Members are able to add a link with a title and a short description.

### Where can I use these collaboration tools?
As mentioned before, the Hosts are now able to use these tools on **any page**! This allows them to ask the question where it makes the most sense. Let's give you some examples:

* A Post on the *Dashboard Tab* to ask for comments, suggestions, feedback.
* A Collection of Links on the *Dashboard Tab* to share guiding materials to get started in this Space.
* A Whiteboard with a stakeholder map on the *Community tab*, so that the community can contribute with their insights about the current ecosystem
* A Post on the *Community tab* to ask members to introduce themselves or suggest other people / organizations to invite (see example below)
* A Collection of Posts on the *Challenges tab* where members can submit ideas for Challenges to work on by filling in a few context questions.
* A Collection of Posts with relevant articles related to the topic on the *Knowledge base tab*

### How can I use templates?
There is a lot of **knowledge, best practices and templates** out there related to innovation. Organizations as well as knowledge institutions often promote these materials via their websites or internal channels, but it is hard to find for the wider community. More importantly, it is hard to directly use when you want to start collaborating with multiple stakeholders. The platform offers an Innovation Library that gathers all these materials and makes them directly available for you to apply in your Space (more information on [this Support Page](https://www.alkemio.org/help/innovation-library/)). 

These templates can be used both when you want to open a new callout as well as when you are submitting a new answer or contribution. Note that in principle the leads are able to open a new callout, but they can also choose to allow **any member** to open a new callout. 

There a two types of templates relevant:
- Post templates
- Whiteboard templates

#### Post templates
These templates allow you to choose a set of default text or questions that each contribution must include. Hereby a few examples as inspiration:
- You want each user to start their answer with a user story. Then you would set as a default text for each post:  *As a user I want ... so that I ...*  Each member can then submit their contribution in a more structured way using this template.
- You want users to submit relevant newsarticles related to a specific Challenge. Then you could state that each contribution must provide a *description*, *why is this relevant for the Challenge*, and *source*.
- You ask the community to share what organizations should be involved. Then you could let members answer a few questions. For example, *why do you think this organization is relevant*, *how would you like to approach them*, and *do you need any help*.
