# **Alkemio Group Structure**
Sharing how Alkemio is being built for long-term success.  

## Background

**Alkemio** is in business to empower society. The purpose of empowering society to solve challenges effectively is at the core of everything we do. We are building a team of employees, partners and investors that share this purpose. Together we are building Alkemio as a profitable and sustainable long-term business to achieve the greatest scale and impact. 

Alkemio offers a broad and ambitious vision, and the Alkemio platform is achieving initial traction in the market. Partners are buying into the vision and purpose of Alkemio, and we are seeing a clear need in the market. However the journey so far is just the start. It is critical that we live up to the expectations of early adopters of the platform, moving from sharing of challenges to significant actual usage by end users of the platform. 

To take the platform to the next level requires significantly increasing the resources available. In particular:
* capital (finance) for investing in the further development of the platform, and 
* top talent to execute the vision. 

It simply is an ambitious vision.
