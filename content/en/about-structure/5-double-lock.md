### **PC share = Double Lock on Purpose**
The adoption of Steward Ownership can be seen as a **double lock** on the purpose of Alkemio. 

This is important for two key reasons:
* investors in Alkemio do not have voting rights, so they are fully dependent on the governance that is in place. 
* as Alkemio achieves significant scale, the venture will be highly valuable - so the locks need to be put in place now to prevent any temptation in the future.

It is simply a _much stronger_ guarantee than relying on the governance of a Foundation.

The Purpose Control (PC) share is held by Stichting de Prioriteit. This entity, establised also in The Netherlands, has the purpose to act as an independent party to guarantee principles of steward ownership are followed in such ventures.

For all stakeholders of Alkemio this double lock is important: investors / contributors who have an economic interest but no voting rights, partners that wish to support the vision, and customers that want to have confidence in the long term roadmap for the platform.
