## Roadmap to Steward Ownership
Stichting Alkemio was established in June 2020, as a foundation in The Netherlands. It operated as a single entity until early 2023, fulfilling multiple roles: building the platform, growing the community and developing the roadmap for the organization. 

However it was clear that a single entity structure, and in particular a foundation, would not be sufficient to realise the full vision, lacking in three key areas:
* Ability to guarantee the purpose
* Ability to raise capital
* Ability to attract top talent

We knew we had found the solution when we heard about **Steward Ownership**, a legal structure for companies that places purpose first and where profit serves the purpose. It is around for many years with long-term successful companies such as Bosch and Zeiss, and now growing in popularity including with Patagonia.

The core features of Steward Ownership, implemented by Alkemio, to highlight are:
* **Leadership**:  "stewards" guide the venture and are chosen based on capability and alignment with the purpose 
* **Independent guarantee**: providing an independent party with blocking rights on key provisions. 
* **Capped economic returns without control**: sharing of economic returns to both investors and talent, without offering control, while also ensuring that ultimately the value generated goes towards the purpose of Alkemio
