## **Next steps on Alkemio’s journey**
Alkemio is making great progress, in terms of both organization structure and market traction. There is still work to be done however to complete the vision, and we share some known gaps to be focused on and the long-term plan. We would also love to hear from anyone who has experience or advice to share with us as we continue down this less-travelled path!

### Roadmap near term
The status as of August 2023 is that the above group structure is in place, and the shares of Alkemio Holding have been issued with the exception of shares CT. In addition the operations have been transferred from Stichting Alkemio to Alkemio BV.

This is a critical milestone as it allows Alkemio to raise the funding required to scale. 

However there is still work to be done:
* **Stichting Alkemio governance**: The board members of Stichting Alkemio are the stewards of Alkemio Holding BV, which currently are Neil Smyth and Rene Honig. There is a Board of Advisors, in place since 2020, providing guidance to the board of Stichting Alkemio. The next phase on the organizational structure journey needs to ensure that (a) additional stewards are appointed, (b) a supervisory board is put in place, and (c) the Board of Advisors is expanded. Provisions are already in place in the Articles of Association of Stichting Alkemio.
* **Staff proposition**: This covers both the scheme for the allocation of CT certificates for staff, as well as greater representation of staff in the wider organizational structure. It is also about putting in place an internationally applicable proposition so that top talent can contribute from anywhere in the world. 
* **Dependence on key players**:  There is too strong a dependence on key individuals (Neil Smyth and Rene Honig) in the above structure. This is not desirable for the long term health of the venture, and it also results in some overlap of control / economic interest. 

All of the above points are on the organizational roadmap and will be addressed. It is important to recognise that Alkemio is still relatively early in its journey and there is only a limited amount of capacity available to develop the organization, build the platform and grow the community. Alkemio is well underway and has achieved a lot, but it is not a given that the venture will succeed - and as such the priority has been to get a scalable and long term structure in place. This is driven by the near term priority to be in a position to raise funds to accelerate the journey and secure Alkemio’s future.

### Roadmap longer term
In the longer term the expectation is that there will be significant profits generated in excess of what is needed to scale the platform and be shared with investors and staff. This is a result of the capping of economic returns for the holders of certificates for shares CT / CC combined with the potential for Alkemio, as a SaaS platform, to be a highly profitable business as it achieves scale.

These excess profits will be for the benefit of the holder of the SE share (currently Stichting Alkemio), to be allocated in line with the purpose of Stichting Alkemio i.e. “enable society to collaborate effectively on hard challenges, together!”. As the platform matures and generates profits for distribution, it is important that the SE share moves to be held by a different entity - to avoid overlap of economic rights and voting control.
