## **Roadmap**
Alkemio is well underway and has made good progress. But there is still work to be done. This section details out known gaps to be focused on and what the long term plan is. 

### Roadmap near term
The status as of August 2023 is that the above group structure is in place, and the shares of Alkemio Holding have been issued with the exception of shares CT. The operations have in addition been transferred from Stichting Alkemio to Alkemio BV.

This is a critical milestone as it allows Alkemio to raise the funding required to scale. 

However there is still work to be done:
* **Stichting Alkemio governance**: The board members are the stewards, which currently are Neil Smyth and Rene Honig. The Board of Advisors is in place already since 2020, providing guidance to the board. However the next phase on the organizational structure journey needs to ensure that (a) additional stewards are appointed (b) a supervisory board is put in place (c) the Board of Advisors is expanded. Provisions are already in place in the AoA for both the additional stewards and the supervisory board creation.
* **Staff proposition**: This covers both the scheme for the allocation of CT certificates for staff, as well as representation into the wider organizational structure. It is also about putting in place an internationally applicable proposition so that top talent can contribute from anywhere in the world. 
* **Dependence on key players**:  there is also simply too strong a dependence on key players in the above structure. This is both not desirable for the long term health of the venture, and it also results in some overlap of control / economic interest. 

All of the above points are on the Alkemio organizational roadmap to be addressed. However it is important to also recognise that there is simply only a limited amount of capacity available to both develop the organization, build the platform and grow the community. The venture is still relatively early and there is simply not yet enough scale / parties involved. 

Alkemio is well underway and has achieved a lot, but it is not a given that the venture will succeed - and as such the priority has been to get a scalable and long term structure in place. This is driven by the near term priority to be in a position to raise funds to accelerate the journey and secure Alkemio's future. 

### Roadmap longer term
in the longer term the expectation is that there will be significant surplus profits generated that are returned to the holder of the SE share (currently Stichting Alkemio). This value is then to be allocated to line with the purpose of Stichting Alkemio i.e. _"enable society to collaborate effectively on hard challenges, together!"_. 

This is a result of capping of economic interest for exernal parties via certificates for shares CT / CC. And Alkemio, as a SAAS platform, has the potential to be a highly profitable business.

As the platform matures and generates profits for distribution, it is important that the SE share moves to be held by a different entity - to avoid overlap of economic and control.
