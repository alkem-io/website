# Getting started!

#### Hello there! Welcome to the Alkemio Community. 
Congrats! You've made it to the most open and collaborative online community out there. ðŸ¤—

In this post we'll set you up for success to make the most of the Alkemio community.
Follow our new member onboarding steps below to jump-start your 'career' as a contributor on Alkemio! It will take you approximately 15 mins, and will save you a bunch of time afterwards. 


### INTRODUCTION: WHY ALKEMIO? 

Using the Alkemio platform, organizations that work with individuals from other organizations can create and group the whole community around a certain theme or project and share knowledge.

For example to avoid having different WhatsApp or Signal groups with a certain number of individuals from one organization and another group with people from another one. In the end, you need to connect to both organizations/groups on the same issue. Using Alkemio is a way of sparing time, being more effective and successful in solving the issue altogether as a community.

### WHAT VALUE CAN I GET FROM THE ALKEMIO COMMUNITY?

Alkemio is the platform launched to reveal the infinite potential of collaboration between organizations, individual users, partners, businesses, researchers, and citizens. Public values should be central to achieve systematic change in how we work together on challenges. Teams/Slack/Google Workspace/Whatsapp/Signal etc. are all great for interacting and managing your project - but they do not put the challenge  or change central. And having a clear shared understanding of the change is critical. Read more about this in our blogpost about community building [here](https://https://alkemio.foundation/post/2022-10-building-up-our-community/).
