# Platform Key Concepts



#### Hello there! In this section you will find listed the key concepts representing the hierarchy of the Alkemio [platform](https://alkem.io), as well as an explanation of their fuctions and utility.
As a new user enterying the platform for the first time you may be asking yourself: what is the meaning behind our platform's terminology for example words such as "Hub", "Challenge", "Opportunity" and "Callout". First follow our new member [onboarding steps](https:hackmd.io/rC9TMNPeQx2L0DagBHPKyg) and begin your journey!




I'm ready to get going! What next? Let's dive into the understanding of the platform's core concepts:

#### 1. We are a platform that works Challenge-Centric, so let's start with understanding what a Challenge is, what can you do through it, why should you create one, and what happens afterwards

##### What's a Challenge?
A Challenge is a specific issue related to the initial more general topic introduced in the Hub of interest and so challenges variate from Hub to Hub and can develop in different ways based on the necessities of the community around the Hub.

Through the creation of a Challenge, one has the chance to spread light on urgent issues that need to be solved that can also be more of a niche but still concern many people. One should create new challenges because, through it, people will get more knowledge on the issue as well as the opportunity to meet people with the same concerns and people that may have already solved those issues and help you out. Or simply it can give you the right network which will bring you closer to find the solution of the issue.

##### What value can I get from a Challenge Community?
Finally, creating a challenge means tackling the general issue into specifics and making people cooperate around these specific issues in orther to work out solutions together. Working in a community and cooperating is the fastest way to successfully solve problems.

#### 2. What is a Hub? What can you do through it, why should you create one and what happens after you created a Hub

Picture a Hub as it was a virtual space created for you to engage on something you care about and that you would like to find solutions for. Or getting further ideas on or simply see it as a place to raise awareness on an issue that you believe is urgent and can be relatable to others.

##### Who can create a Hub?
A Hub can be created by members of the platform, together with us, based on a general topic that the creator has interest in. A demo of an example Hub can be found here:["Air pollution"](https://alkem.io/reducingpollution/dashboard)



##### What value can I get from a Hub Community?
Through a hub, you can raise attention to a topic of your interest and find more people that share your same interest but have different visions. It is important to create Hubs because through different Hubs the topics of interest that regard different people will lead to inspiration for more. This will allow the creation of different communities around meaningful topics that are relevant to many. Creating a Hub means generating knowledge on relevant areas that can then be divided into specific "challenges", a step that brings us to the next key concept of our platform.


#### 3. What are opportunities, why should you carate one, what can you do by creating one and what happens after creating one

Opportunities represent the actions that people within the community can take concerning a certain challenge. There is always a solution for each challenge and to solve issues we need suggestions on how to do so. Therefore, by creating an opportunity you are providing possible solutions to solve the challenges, sharing your personal experiences, conncentions and knowledges for example. Creting opportunities menas creating possible solutions for others and yourself as well.

##### 4. What is a callout, why should callouts be created, what can you do by creating callouts

Callouts are essentially possible questions people may want to raise after starting to work on a challenge. Callouts should be created to make concepts clearer and answer possible questions the community may have. It is a way to involve the community and get feedback on how the overall hub is progressing. If you are interested in reading more about it fell free to read our [blog post](https://www.alkemio.foundation/post/2022-09-callouts/) about it! Enjoy :)
