## **Understanding the Economic Returns**
The economic returns to investors and staff are capped. This is a core feature of Steward Ownership, to ensure all parties are aligned with the purpose of benefitting society. Excess profits will be used/donated in line with the purpose.

The cap level for early investors is 3x-3.5x, depending on timing of investment. The full mechanism is described in schedule C of the [Alkemio Holding Shareholders Agreement](./documents/alkemio_holding_shareholders_agreement_v1.1.pdf) - with a worked example provided here.

Example: 
*	A cap of 3x means an investment of E100 will entitle that investor to dividends of up to E300
*	From 4 years after the investment date, if the investor has not yet received the full E300, the balance (E300 minus cumulative dividends received) will start to accrue at a certain annual rate to be determined. If the balance is E200 after 4 years and the annual rate is 5% the amount of future dividends the investor is entitled to will increase to E210 after 5 years. So the effective cap on total cumulative dividends would have increased to E310, or 3.1x.

It is important to note that the potential return level is capped  *at the time of the investment*. This is different for example than when buying shares in a startup - there the maximum potential return is unknown: it depends on how the startup does. 

*Each CC certificate has a fixed entitlement to dividends*. The capped return is determined by the number of certificates received. So if an investor puts in EUR100,000 at a multiple of 3x, and each certificate has a dividend entitlement of EUR1,000 then the investor receives in total 300 certificates (100,000*3 / 1000). 

This gives investors the potential to do very well economically while they are also enjoying huge social and inspiration returns.
