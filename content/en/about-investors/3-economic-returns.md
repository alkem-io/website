## **Understanding the Economic Returns**
The economic returns to investors, and staff are capped. This is a core feature of Steward Ownership, to ensure all parties are aligned with the purpose of benefitting society. Excess profits will be used/donated in line with the purpose.

The cap level for early investors is 3x-3.5x, depending on timing of investment. The full mechanism is described in schedule C of the [Alkemio Holding Shareholders Agreement](./documents/alkemio_holding_shareholders_agreement.pdf) - with a worked example provided here.

Example: 
*	A cap of 3x means an investment of E100 will entitle that investor to dividends of up to E300
*	From 4 years after the investment date, if the investor has not yet received the full E300, the balance (E300 minus cumulative dividends received) will start to accrue at a certain annual rate to be determined. If the balance is E200 after 4 years and the annual rate is 5% the amount of future dividends the investor is entitled to will increase to E210 after 5 years. So the effective cap on total cumulative dividends would have increased to E310, or 3.1x

This gives investors the potential to do very well economically while they are also enjoying huge social and inspiration returns.
