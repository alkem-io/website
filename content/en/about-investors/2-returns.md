## **Multiple Returns**
Investment in Alkemio offers three types of returns: 
* **Economic returns**: Up to a specified multiple of the invested amount. For early investors that multiple is 3.5x or 3x. 
* **Social returns**: Alkemio has the potential to really impact our society on a massive scale. It is hard to overstate the potential: much more effective progress on key challenges, collaboration on digital platforms that put societal values first, avoiding duplication of efforts, more inclusivity and engagement across society. 
* **Inspiration returns**: Our society is increasingly digital, and the digital platforms are dominated by parties whose interests do not align with societyâ€™s interests. This status quo is not a given, and Alkemio is aiming to inspire many more people and organizations to move towards a future where digitalization works for society!

This is the first external funding round of Alkemio, with attractive returns for the early investors who help Alkemio to scale and accelerate the impact
