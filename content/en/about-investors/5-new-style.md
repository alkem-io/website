## **New Style of Investing Opportunity**
In line with Alkemioâ€™s choice of Steward Ownership, there are features of this investment opportunity that differ from those of a typical venture capital backed startup. The capped economic returns, strong social returns and purpose to benefit society have already been mentioned above. 


Some other notable points include:
*	**Voting control** is held by stewards of the company, not by investors, to ensure decisions are made in line with achieving the long-term purpose 
*	A **special share** is held by an independent 3rd party, whose consent is needed for certain key matters related to achieving the purpose. These include a change of the purpose, a sale of the company, etc.
*	Investors should look to expected returns from dividends over the medium-long term, instead of from a company sale. The company is set up to **remain independent**, to build a very successful long-term business focused on the purpose.
* **Simple setup**, with no special shares / setup for founders.
*	The timing and process of **raising new funds** can be easier and quicker than for typical VC funded startups. The capped returns and control by stewards mean there is no cap table or voting rights to protect, or valuation to spend lengthy discussions on. 

Further details of steward ownership and how Alkemio is set up can be found on the [group structure overview](./structure)

_The more capital Alkemio can raise the faster we can scale and make impact_. 

Alkemio is doing the first external fundraising, and we are looking to build a wider community of backers (people and organizations) who share the vision. 

It is an ambitious vision, and one we believe is very achievable and worthwhile. Join us on this exciting journey to make a real difference in society! Do well and do good.
