# **Do Well and Do Good**
Interested in accelerating the Alkemio journey while doing well?  

## Returns
Investment in Alkemio offers three types of returns: 
* **Economic returns**: capped economic returns, a multiple of the capital invested
* **Social returns**: Alkemio has the potential to really impact our society on a massive scale. It is hard to over state the potential: much more effective progress on key challenges, collaboration on digital platforms that put societal values first, avoiding duplication of efforts, more inclusity and engagement across society. 
* **Inspiration returns**: our society is increasingly digital, and the digital platforms are dominated by parties whose interests do not align with societies interests. This status quo is not a given, and Alkemio is aiming to inspire many more people and organizations to work towards a future where digitalization works for society!
