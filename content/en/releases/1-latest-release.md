<b>Release 2023-03-02</b>

<i>Prepare yourself for a list full of new updates in [this 2023-03-02 release](https://alkem-25488729.hs-sites-eu1.com/alkemio-release-2023-03-02)!

Continuing our focus on enabling you to **engage** your community, we have added the ability to **tag/mention other users or organizations** as well as **search within your Hub**. Both important improvements. Next to that we also got clear feedback that Alkemio for new users needed to be easier to understand, so we have added a **new landing page** to guide new users, as well as the ability **group communities** on the existing home page by theme!</i>
