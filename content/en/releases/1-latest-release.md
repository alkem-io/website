This release includes some mayor improvements, such as improved conversations with <b>threaded replies and emoticons</b>. For the admins, there has been a refresh of the <b>Space settings</b>, which simplifies the basic set-up of your Space as well as community management. And the much requested ability to see only a subset of the content of the platform... the Innovation Hubs! These Hubs provide a filtered view to see a set of Spaces related to a topic, organization or initiative.</i>
