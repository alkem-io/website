<i>[This release](https://alkem-25488729.hs-sites-eu1.com/alkemio-release-2022-11-28) focuses on two key updates. First, happy to anounce that it is now possible to <b>upload documents</b>! Instead of storing the document online, you can now directly upload documents from your computer. Secondly, a key part of the Alkemio vision is to allow much better sharing of knowledge on how to effectively achieve change together. Therefore, it is now possible to find best practices via the <b>Alkemio Innovation library</b>. Organizations can share their knowledge and insights as innovation packs and these packs can directly be imported in the Hub. </i>
