<b>Release 2023-01-31</b>
<p></p>

<i>[This release]([https://alkem-25488729.hs-sites-eu1.com/alkemio-release-2023-01-31) is another major one :)! The releases in early 2023 have focused mostly on refining the user interface refresh from late last year and non-visible updates such as performance improvements - but we are back to more visible updates! Key additions to highlight are the adding of the events calendar, simplified usage of whiteboards and private Challenges.</i>
