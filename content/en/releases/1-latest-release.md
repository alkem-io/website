<b>Release 2022-12-23</b>
<p></p>

<i>[This release](https://alkem-25488729.hs-sites-eu1.com/alkemio-release-2022-12-23) is a major one! And hopefully a nice Christmas present :) It includes two key updates. First, happy to anounce that you can now sign up with your <b>LinkedIn</b> account! This removes another barrier to start contributing and can immediately make the profile richer. Secondly, and the most visible one, is the <b>refresh of the user interface</b>. It includes global changes for textstyles, 1:2 lay-out, colors, and improving accessibility. Furthermore, you'll see a lot of changes on the journey pages. The interface has improved, <b>recommendations and top callouts</b> have been added, as well as a better overview of callouts and Challenges.</i>
