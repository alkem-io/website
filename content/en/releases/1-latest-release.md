<i>After the visible front-end improvements of recent deployments, [the latest release](https://alkem-25488729.hs-sites-eu1.com/alkemio-release-2022-10-31) focuses more on "the basics" such as seeing activity entries in real time and optimizing the client-server interaction. Also, it highlights the ability to close callouts and the refresh of the Contributors page.</i>
