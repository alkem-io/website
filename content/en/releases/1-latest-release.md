Alkemio makes updates to the production platform approximately every two weeks. Below you can find the latest release note as well as links to previous notes.

<b>Release 2023-09-29</b>

<i>Prepare yourself for a list full of new updates in [this 2023-11-01 release](http://alkem-25488729.hs-sites-eu1.com/alkemio-release-2023-11-01)!

The main navigation of the platform is refreshed, to put the focus on your community.

Alkemio now takes the role of <b>"powering"</b> your Space. So "Alkemio" will be much less visible. This big and important change also allowed us to simplify the user navigation.

The user in a Space is primarily interested in working in the Space. The <b>platform level jobs</b>, such as finding other contributors or challenges as well as best practices, are now gathered in one menu button - leading to the same platform pages as before. We aim to avoid users getting lost or distracted but keep the ability to interact with the wider platform.

All <b>search interaction</b> is now gathered in a single search menu bar, providing the option to search either just within the Space or across the full platform. 

The platform level jobs to be done are now gathered in one menu button - leading the the same platform pages as before.
