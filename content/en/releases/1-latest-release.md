<b>Release 2023-04-24</b>

<i>Prepare yourself for a list full of new updates in [this 2023-04-24 release](https://alkem-25488729.hs-sites-eu1.com/alkemio-release-2023-04-24)!

Besides important functionality, this release also introduces a fairly fundamental naming change: **Spaces**! This is the new name for Hub. The change of name reflects our drive to simplify the platform conceptually, and it actually reflects what it is: *a dedicated online space to enable a Community to come together and and make impact on shared Challenges*. The functionality is what you are familiar with, but hopefully the new name helps with on-boarding new platform users.

And this ties in nicely with the Alkemio community feedback that users want to contribute on multiple ways: to growing the community, to framing challenges, to building up shared knowledge. This is now possible! So no more "contribute" tab, but instead users **directly contribute** to the relevant section. This has lead to a big improvement (we think!) in terms of usability of Spaces - please read further to find out more!.</i>
