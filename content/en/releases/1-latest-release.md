<b>Release 2023-07-20</b>
<p></p>

<i>Prepare yourself for a list full of new updates in [this 2023-07-20 release](https://alkem-25488729.hs-sites-eu1.com/alkemio-release-2023-07-20)!

After a big refresh of the lay-out and functionalities of the Space, it was time to dive into the <b>Challenges & Opportunities</b>. One very important element there: a more prominent role for the <b>innovation flow</b> that will guide your Challenge or Opportunity.

Furthermore, the <b>banner of Challenges & Opportunities</b> has been improved, leads can send <b>invites</b> to both Alkemio users as well as non-Alkemio users, and you can easily filter Challenges as the <b>Challenge tags</b> are now visualized.</i>
