We are here to help if you need support with the platform! 

Our preferred way to provide support is through using our support pages hosted at our [Github discussions page](https://github.com/alkem-io/alkemio/discussions), as other users can benefit from that too.

If you prefer not to share the request publicly you can fill in the form below (requires email confirmation):

<script charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript" src="//js-eu1.hsforms.net/forms/v2.js"></script>
<script>
  hbspt.forms.create({
	region: "eu1",
	portalId: "25488729",
	formId: "010ecef9-9d4f-4b50-8a1e-9b282f04037b"
});
</script>
