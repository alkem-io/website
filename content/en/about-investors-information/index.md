      title: A NEW STYLE OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY
      text: |-
        In line with Alkemio’s choice of Steward-Ownership, some investment features differ from a typical venture capital backed startup. Designed for long-term investors who really care about Alkemio’s purpose.

        - **Guided by stewards**, not shareholders. Stewards hold and control the voting shares to ensure the business is managed to achieve the purpose.
        - Alkemio’s purpose and independence are **legally locked in**. An independent 3rd party holds a special share with a veto right on certain decisions such as a sale or change of the purpose of the company.
        - For **all stakeholders**, not just shareholders. Investor economic returns are capped at levels that provide attractive returns. Excess profits will be used/donated to benefit society. Profit serves purpose.
        - With investor economic returns coming from **dividends** and/or **share repurchase**, instead of a sale of the company.

        Full details of how Alkemio has implemented Steward Ownership legally, please visit our **Alkemio Group structure overview**.

        **Simple setup, easy to scale.** A single share class for all investors, including founders. The capped returns and steward control mean there are no cap table, valuation, or investor voting rights discussions. So management can focus on scaling a very successful business.

      title: THE WHY AND HOW OF THE ECONOMIC RETURNS! (table is wrong - check it)
      text: |-
        The capping of economic returns to all investors and staff helps ensure alignment of all parties with the purpose of benefiting society.

        The cap level for early investors starts at 3x-3.5x, depending on timing of investment. From 4 years after the investment date, the outstanding amount payable to an investor will start to accrue at a certain annual rate, such that the effective cap level can increase to 4x-5x.

        **Example:**

        | Year | Year 2-4 | Year 5 | Year 6 | Year 7 | Year 8 |
        |------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
        | Investment amount | €1,000 |
        | Initial dividend entitlement amount | €3,000 |
        | Dividend amount in each year | €0 | €0 | €0 | €200 | €300 | -€500 |
        | Annual increase due to accrual | €0 | €0 | €210 | €211 | €204 | €184 |
        | Outstanding dividend entitlement amount | €3,000 | €3,000 | €3,210 | €3,221 | €3,125 | €2,809 |
        | Effective capped return multiple | 3.0 | 3.0 | 3.2 | 3.4 | 3.6 | 3.8 |

        - A cap of 3x means an investment of €1,000 will create a dividend entitlement for that investor which starts at €3,000.
        - 4 years after the investment date, the outstanding dividend entitlement amount will accrue at an annual rate of 7%.
        - Each year the outstanding dividend entitlement amount will (a) decrease by dividends received and (b) increase at the accrual rate.

        The full mechanism, including issuance of certificates, is described in schedule C of the **Alkemio Holding Shareholders Agreement**.
