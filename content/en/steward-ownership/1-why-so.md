# Steward Ownership

**Alkemio** is in business to empower society. The purpose of empowering society to solve challenges effectively is at the core of everything we do. We are building a team of employees, partners and investors that share this purpose. Together we are building Alkemio as a profitable and sustainable long-term business to achieve the greatest scale and impact. 

Alkemio offers a broad and ambitious vision, and the Alkemio platform is achieving initial traction in the market. Partners are buying into the vision and purpose of Alkemio, and we are seeing a clear need in the market. However the journey so far is just the start. It is critical that we live up to the expectations of early adopters of the platform, moving from sharing of challenges to significant actual usage by end users of the platform. 

To take the platform to the next level requires significantly increasing the resources available. In particular, capital (finance) for investing in the further development of the platform and top talent to execute the vision are key. It simply is an ambitious vision. 

Stichting Alkemio was established in June 2020, and operated as a single entity until early 2023. However to raise the resources required, and to ensure the mission cannot be compromised as Alkemio takes off, required a new organizational structure.

**Steward Ownership** ensures that profit serves purpose, and anchors the mission of Alkemio for the long term. The core aspects to highlight are:
* Leadership "stewards" guide the venture and are chosen based on capability and alignment with the mission
* Independent party with blocking rights on key provisions in Alkemio Holding. 
* Capped economic return on investments, with investments not having voting rights

The organizational structure is shown below.

Key documents:
* Stichting Alkemio Articles of Association (AoA) (Dutch)
* Alkemio Holding Articles of Association (AoA)  (Dutch)
* Alkemio Holding Issuance of share PC + shares CC (Dutch)
* Alkemio Holding Shareholders Agreement (SHA) (English) 
* Alkemio Holding Chamber of Commerce (KvK) registration (Dutch)
* STAK Participanten Alkemio Articles of Association (AoA) (Dutch)
* STAK Participanten Alkemio Conditions (Dutch)

One might argue that a foundation (Stichting Alkemio) is already sufficient to guarantee the mission of Alkemio, but this is not strong enough. The adoption of Steward Ownership as such can be seen as a **double lock** on the purpose of Alkemio. This is important for two key reasons:
* investors in Alkemio do not have voting shares, so they are fully dependent on the governance that is in place. 
* as Alkemio achieves significant scale, the venture will be highly valuable - so the locks need to be put in place now to prevent any temptation in the future

Important to note that Alkemio Holding is the Steward Ownership venture. The key document is probably the Alkemio Holding SHA, which together with the Alkemio Holding AoA ensures that that purpose remains central. 

The Purpose Control (PC) share is held by Stichting de Prioriteit, an entity establised also in The Netherlands with the purpose to act as an independent party guaranteeing principles of steward ownership are followed in such ventures.

**Simple**
One interesting aspect of the above design is that it is actually much **simpler** in some ways 


**Roadmap**
The structure above allows Alkemio to raise the funding required to scale. However there is still work to be done:
* The governance of Stichting Alkemio to be enriched with (a) additional stewards (b) a supervisory board. Provisions are already in place in the AoA for both, but it is simply a question of available capacity from the core team to put this in place.
* The staff proposition, via the certificates CT
