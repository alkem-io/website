        Alkemio Foundation</h2>
        Established in 2020 with the belief that there must be a better and faster way of working together to make progress! 
        <br> <br>
        The trigger was frustration at lack of progress collaborating on COVID-related challenges, but also recognizing the many fast-moving challenges in our lives.
        <br> <br>
        To make society more inclusive, improve energy security, tackle the cost of living crises and the impact of AI on our jobs and education, and many more.  <br> <br>
        Connect, collaborate and contribute!
