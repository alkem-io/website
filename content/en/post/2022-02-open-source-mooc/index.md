Open source is a key focus topic for the Dutch government. And deepending understanding of what open source is about, from the code to the community, is critical to deliver on its potential. 

For this an [online course](https://omooc.nl/moocs/open-source/) has been created, consisting of 4 episodes each with 3 interviews. 

Delighted to have had the chance to contribute (via Neil in his "best" dutch) to this important topic. Kudos to the open source team at the [Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken](minbzk.nl) and [Vereniging voor OverheidsManagement](https://www.vom-online.nl/) for putting it in motion. Our contribution is in [episode 2](https://omooc.nl/inzicht/open-source-de-nieuwe-standaard/). 

Unfortunately for our non-dutch community the course is in dutch, but you can use on an online translation service to try to follow it. 

Open source is at the core of Alkemio. The principles that underlie we believe are also applicable to many of the collaborations needed to address the Challenges in society.
