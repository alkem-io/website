*As stated in our manifesto, we love big tech, but not how it is often used. We should ensure that technology supports and works for society instead of the other way around. That is why we are happy to see the growing movement around open source and data privacy regulations for big tech companies in the Netherlands.*

There is no escaping from big tech companies, but it is still possible to turn the use of it into a positive impact. We have learned from the dominating positions of Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc. While they all started as disruptors and innovators in the starting phases, they have become too powerful or influential in society. 
Bigtech is everywhere and tends to dominate a lot of societal's 
Dutch environment is really taming the big companies

Really focusing on a future where big tech is used for society and not society for big tech

Let's discuss a few examples, where the Dutch authorities aim to tame these Bigtech companies

### Open source 
In the beginning of this year, there was a dispute concerning whether or not sharing open source software was an infringement of competition. The Netherlands Competition Authority has now confirmed its previous decision that a public administration can share the software.

ACM argues that in general sharing these source codes has many societal advantages and therefore there are no indications that the proper functioning of the market has been compromised. 

that stated that sharing of open source software by a public administration is not an infringement of competition. within the dutch government there has already been regulation in place to refer to open-source unless

There is already regulation on its way to exclude open source from the Law Market & government.

These decisions can have a big impact on tech-enterpreneurs that grow through selling licences at a low rate too many people. We have to become more innovative to include the open source mentality in our current business models.

### GDPR 
Even though the GDPR is one of the toughest security laws, big tech companies still try to get away with minimum or below minimum effort to comply. 

An example of Dutch Data Protectio Authority is the privacy concerns around Google's education apps. A audit from two Dutch universities highlighted the lack of privacy protections and breach of European law.

### Conclusion
We are very happy to see the growing consensus and these regulations that focus on  

It is clear that technology will continue to have an important role in our daily lives. So we should really consider the right way of using them. 

Let's use technology for achieving our societal goals, the efficiency it can offer, the low costs, ability to share and connect across the entire world. 

If we want to stimulate open innovation, and solve societal challenges while keeping up with new technologies, open source is key.
