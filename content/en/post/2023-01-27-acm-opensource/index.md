*As stated in our [manifesto](alkem.foundation/manifesto), we love big tech, but not how it is often used. We should ensure that technology supports and works for society instead of the other way around. That is why we are happy to see the growing movement in the Netherlands around open source and data privacy regulations for big tech companies.*

There is no escaping from the use of technology nor from big tech companies, but we can ensure to keep public values central and to aim for a sustainable positive impact. We have learned from the dominating positions of Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc. While they all started as disruptive innovators in the starting phases, they have become very powerful and influential in society.

Lately, the several Dutch institutions have demonstrated that you should not underestimate a small country. The Netherlands was already famous for it's landmark decisions in the two well-known climate cases, the [Urgenda case](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/20/climate/netherlands-climate-lawsuit.html) and the [class action case](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/26/court-orders-royal-dutch-shell-to-cut-carbon-emissions-by-45-by-2030) against Royal Dutch Shell. Lately, there have been several Dutch institutions also focusing on two other aspects to ensure technology is used the right way.

### ACM ruling on open source 
In the beginning of this year, there was a dispute concerning whether or not sharing open source software was an infringement of competition. The Netherlands Competition Authority has now [confirmed](https://www.acm.nl/nl/publicaties/acm-verklaart-het-bezwaar-tegen-prioriteringsbesluit-ongegrond) its previous decision that a public administration **can** share the software. This recent ruling is a major step forward in stimulating open source in our country. 

ACM argues that in general sharing these source codes has many societal advantages and therefore there are no indications that the proper functioning of the market has been compromised. It is in line with the strategy by the Dutch government aiming for more open source within the government, summarised as "open, unless". Also, there is a pending legal proposal to ensure open source is exempted from the Act on Government and Free Markets. 

There has been some resistance as this decision can have a big impact on tech-enterpreneurs that grow through selling licences at a low rate too many people. We have to become more innovative to include the open source mentality in our current business models. We believe it is possible! An open source business model can lead to more innovation, knowledge sharing and collaboration, all with public values in mind.

### DPA ruling on data pricvacy 
There are also other examples where the Netherlands is stimulating technology to be open, safe, and beneficial for society. Even though the GDPR is one of the toughest security laws, big tech companies still try to get away with minimum or below minimum effort to comply. An example of Dutch Data Protectio Authority is the privacy concerns around Google's education apps. A audit from two Dutch universities highlighted the lack of privacy protections and breach of European law.

### Conclusion
We are very happy to see the growing consensus and these regulations al focused on stimulating technology for good. It is clear that technology will continue to have an important role in our daily lives. Let's use technology for achieving our societal goals, the efficiency it can offer, the low costs, ability to share and connect across the entire world. If we want to stimulate open innovation, and solve societal challenges while keeping up with new technologies, open source is key. 

In conclusion, the ruling by the ACM in the Netherlands and the other regulations in place in the country, such as GDPR and the DPA, are essential in ensuring that technology works for society. It's important that we all continue to support open source and strive for a more collaborative and fair technology landscape. It's important that society is not the slave of technology but the other way around.
