We are pleased to announce the new Cherrytwist website is now live!
An updated design with refreshed content. The source content is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/cherrytwist/website), and then the website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the [Wowchemy theme](https://wowchemy.com). 

Following our decentralisation philosophy, the site is hosted on the [InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.tech/).

We hope you like the update and blazingly fast load speed...
