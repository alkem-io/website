[Digicampus](https://digicampus.tech), founding partner and launching customer for Alkemio, is hosting a one day summit on October 12th on International Collaboration & Innovation. A very interesting line up of talks. 

The program and registration for the summit is [available online](https://digicampus.tech/international-collaborative-innovation-summit-2/).

Hopefully the first of many such summits!
