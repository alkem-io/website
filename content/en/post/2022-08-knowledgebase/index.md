*The Alkemio platform is growing! With the expansion of our users, guidance becomes more and more important. That is why we have made the first step towards sharing our **knowledge base**!*

This knowledge base will overtime include a FAQ, how-to guides, tips and tricks for using the platform, relevant articles, etc. 

### Frequently Asked Questions
A good addition is that we have put up our first version of the **Frequently Asked Questions**. 


The FAQ can be accessed via [Alkemio Foundation website](https://www.alkemio.foundation/faq/) and the help icon on the [Alkemio Platform](https://alkem.io). The FAQ currently includes several questions related to the use of our platform, Alkemio in general, and the Foundation behind Alkemio.

It is an initial set of questions that we will be expanding over the coming weeks, so please have a look and share your suggestions!

### Tips and Tricks: Markdown
As usage of Alkemio grows, we see how Alkemio is used on a daily basis. One example topic that is worth diving deeper into is **Markdown**.

Markdown is an easy way to add **formatting elements** to text documents. On the Alkemio platform, Markdown fields are for example used for *Updates*, *Context* of your Hub/Challenge/Opportunity, or Aspect *descriptions*. As visualized below, it can be used in many ways.

For example, you can insert *links* in your Hub Context to relevant Opportunities, important Aspects, or active Canvases. Also, *videos and images* can be embedded to make your text more visually appealing.

The possibilities are endless, and you can find them online via for example the [Guides provided by Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Have a look and play around with it on our platform!
