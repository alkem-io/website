## Connecting with growing movement for public interest technology!
*Digitalization* is already core to how society interacts. And *reach and influence* of the digital platforms we depend on daily are only accelerating. There is growing awareness of the importance of digitalization for our future. 


Thankfully instead of resigning themselves to a perceived inevitable outcome, where big tech as we know it dominates more and more of society, more people and organizations  are taking action. To explore different and better ways for how technology can be built, placing the interests of people and society first. Especially for technologies that are the foundations of how our society works.


In this blogpost we have brought together some of the key themes people are focusing on, and also highlight some of the key players and initiatives worldwide. It is a fascinating topic, and one which has potential for massive impact.

### **Key themes** 
* **Create**: To be proactive and create new tech designed to benefit society; encouraging innovation instead of just regulating big tech
* **Education**: To have safe spaces for students to engage and learn together and with AI, without their data being absorbed by big tech
* **Control**: Giving control of data back to people, and digital autonomy to nations
* **Digitalisation of society**: As this accelerates with AI, do we want profit maximising big tech controlling our healthcare, our pensions, our kids’ education, etc.
* **Algorithms**: Taking away the algorithms that give excessive attention to the person who shouts the loudest; to protect democracy and prevent polarisation
* **Inclusiveness**: Ensuring technology serves the needs of all people
* **Open and Transparent**: With open source, so we can trust and learn from each other 


## **Public Interest Tech movement**
The set of organizations and foundations that are driving the Public Interest Tech movement is growing. Below are some of the key players we have so far identified and are following. It is noticeable how the types of players driving this movement vary depending on the regions!


### **Netherlands**
In our home base of the Netherlands, the public sector and the private sector are both involved in pushing this topic forward, often working together. Though it is still early days in terms of what can and needs to be done! 

Key players include: Digicampus, GovTech NL, PublicSpaces, Rathenau Institute, SIDN Fonds, City of The Hague, Province of South Holland, Freedom Internet, International Center for Future Generations, Jose van Dijck, Bert Hubert


### **Europe**
The EU has been a leader in regulating the dominance and behaviour of big tech companies. There is now an increased emphasis on taking positive actions and increasing innovation, including by European foundations and politicians. 

Key players includes: EU Digital Service Act, Stiftung Bertelsmann, Stiftung Mercator Switzerland, Werner Stengg, Mario Draghi, Reset Tech, Katapult Future Fest


### **US**
In the US the private sector has taken the lead, especially by foundations and universities. And in July the White House got involved! Bringing the power of US foundations to this topic is a source of great hope for expanding the movement and really expanding public interest tech. 

Some of the players include: Omidyar Network, Project Liberty, McGovern Foundation, PIT-UN, Ford Foundation, Siegel Family Endowment, Center for Humane Technology, Mozilla, Aspen Digital Institute, All Tech is Human, NewPublic


### **Other regions**
Our focus has to date been on understanding the landscape in Europe and the US. Taiwan and Singapore stand out as taking the lead on this topic in Asia, and we will continue to explore initiatives in other regions worldwide.
