Thanks to our partner **Digicampus**, all online sessions held during the celebration of their second anniversary on July 8 [are now available online](https://digicampus.tech/terugkijken-online-sessies-2-jaar-digicampus/).

In our [Alkemio launch and demo presentation](https://player.vimeo.com/video/577566235), co-founders Neil Smyth, Ren√© Honig, and Digicampus portfolio manager Flori Spoelstra present the possibilities of our open source platform and explain how people and organizations can benefit by using it to work together on solving societal challenges. 

They answer some of the most frequent questions, such as why a new open innovation hub is needed; how is Alkemio different; how it is sustainable; what can the platform already enable and plans for the future; and how it can be used for collaboration. 

Since our platform is created for everyone, we are inviting you to try out our [public preview](https://alkem.io) of the Open Innovation Hub. Please sign up, create your profile and connect to the Challenges hosted there that you want to collaborate on!

There is also a [playground / demo environment](https://demo.alkem.io) - please reach out if you would like to have a space to explore how hosting your own public/private challenges on Alkemio can help you!
