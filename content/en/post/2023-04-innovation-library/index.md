Innovation is not always easy and at Alkemio we want to make it easier for everyone to innovate effectively.Â 

The Innovation Library on Alkemio makes it easier to share best practices for effective innovation. Enabling everyone to know how to make the changes that society needs. It is growing daily, with new templates from multiple parties sharing knowledge and expertise.

### Using Whiteboard templates on the platform
As a user, I want to make use of best practice whiteboard templates to support my innovation or community building efforts. 
As a provider of templates, I want to them to be available for and widely used by all platform users. 

When you open a new whiteboard, you can now choose from the templates selected by the host as well as browsing through all platform templates! This is one step closer to making all knowledge around innovation or community building more directly available for you to use!
