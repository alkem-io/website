We are delighted and proud to announce that <b>[Jan van Ginkel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/janvanginkel1965/)</b> has joined the board of advisors of Alkemio! 

Jan has held many important positions in the public sector in the Netherlands and cares deeply about building a better society for all. 

As for Jan's rational for advising Alkemio: 
<br/><br/>
<i>"There are now countless platforms that create social added value. The unique thing about Alkemio is that this digital platform does full justice to all conceivable democratic and moral principles. 
<br/><br/>
I think that is very special, even though it really shouldn't be special at all. 
<br/><br/>
Alkemio therefore deserves a strong position with governments, between governments and in collaboration with residents, companies and social organizations. 

I would like to contribute to this in an advisory role."</i>

That <b>[expedition](https://kennis.zuid-holland.nl/evenementen/toekomst-van-publieke-platformen/)</b> made it abundently clear that there was deep alignment.
