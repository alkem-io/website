# Help Ukraine

__Our world has changed__. The world we had is gone, and we are looking at how we can best react to the new reality.

The suffering and destruction is beyond belief, and heart breaking. We do also see the positiveness in humanity in how many parties are trying to help.

Lots of initiatives are springing up to deal with the situation. People, organziations, governments are all looking to contribute. The challenge is in how to align these contributions effectively.

## Helping
Helping society work together is literally our mission.

Alkemio is built to align contributions from multiple parties. Working towards a common goal. Collecting the wisdom of the crowd around a topic. Allowing people to connect and contribute to the topics they care about.


## Our offer
We are looking to help any initiative responding to the suffering in Ukraine or in what it means for us.

Our offer is to help you to give you a place where your community can connect and work together. Surfacing up ideas for being more effective, enriching your shared context, understanding blockers, connecting to the right skills, new collaborations etc. This is not about another housing matching platform, but about how all busy with this topic can make it more effective. 

Making clear what are the different topics being worked, what can be improved and how people can contribute. Alkemio is still in public preview, getting better every day. We actively listen to what the community needs and take that forward into the platform. 

Alkemio will host your hub free, and we will also help you setup your space for the collaboration.
