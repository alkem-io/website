On the 25th September, Alkemio together with The Hague Municipality and The Hague Tech hosted a panel discussion around Steward-Ownership discussing how it enables public and private entities to align efforts and work together to make greater impact. Gaining in popularity, Steward-Ownership provides a huge opportunity to enable an economy focused on benefitting society.   

The panel discussion was an opportunity to understand how this model works more in detail, its potential, and discuss ways to overcome challenges into the world of steward-ownership and private/public collaboration.  

To boil it down, we had a panel composed of a rich set of different expertise and background. The panel was formed by Nitesh Bharosa the first professor on GovTech and Innovation at TU Delft and Academic Director at Digicampus, Inge van Pelt from the legal perspective as a Notaris, Gijsbert Koren initiator of We are Stewards, Neil Smyth from Alkemio and finally, Nina de Korte as a moderator and expert, also from We Are Stewards.

We started the session by first understanding the public present and what were their expectations during the event. Also in the audience, the background was quite diverse, from scholars, to companies and start-ups, government representatives, among others. Which reflected on the different levels of knowledge around the subject and interests.   

## The principles of Steward-Ownership

Diving in on the discussions, one challenge identified is the fear of disturbing the market that often holds back government support. For instance, steward-ownership offers the potential to gather private funds for public goods, but it requires a change in mindset and raising awareness. Companies shouldn't have to navigate excessive obstacles in their journey towards steward-ownership.  
 
As organizations mature, finding dedicated stewards becomes essential, and establishing checks and controls is crucial for maintaining transparency and accountability.  
 
It's clear that collaboration and dialogue are key in shaping the future of steward-owned enterprises.

One of the highlights of our discussion was the inspiring success stories from Denmark, a country that has paved the way for steward-owned companies on a grand scale. Examples include the Carlsberg and the Novo Nordisk, demonstrating how steward-ownership can fuel sustainable growth while making a substantial societal impact.  
 
## Supporting Start-ups on Their Journey 
 
While these large-scale examples are inspiring, we also explored ways to extend the benefits of steward-ownership to start-ups and smaller businesses. We discussed the importance of providing models that simplify the transition process, challenging the conventional corporate setup as the only standard, and offering guidance to budding steward-owned enterprises.  
 
## Measuring Social Impact  

In a time when success means more than just economic gains, we raised the questions on how to measure the social impact and commitment. How can we quantify the positive influence of steward-ownership beyond monetary metrics? This conversation highlighted the need to align interests with a broader spectrum of stakeholders and promote a more holistic view of success.  
 
## (Some) Barriers and solutions 
 
Our dialogue also delved into the challenges that often hinder government and companies the support for steward-ownership. These blockers include competition law (mededingingsrecht), the time and financial resources required for transitioning, adapting procurement processes, and the cultural barriers that exist, in the Netherlands, but also in different contexts. 
 
As we move towards the end of our event, it became clear that while steward-ownership offers exciting possibilities, it also demands a shift in mindset and concerted efforts from various stakeholders. Our journey continues, and together, we can pave the way for a more sustainable and equitable business landscape.
