We are happy to announce that [**Alkemio**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/alkemio) (Alchemy in Esperanto, pronounciation: /alkeËˆmio/) is the new name for our open innovation platform! Our new name reflects that solving complex challenges needs a mix of knowledge, collaboration, creativity, dedication and magic.

We change our name and logo, but our goals and values remain unchanged: delivering a new open innovation platform, building a better future together. Open source, not-for-profit. Same dedicated team.
