The platform continuously welcomes new communities that want to make a change. However, we are also very lucky to have some partners from the beginning that have followed and contributed to the Alkemio journey for a longer time..

One of these examples is VNG, currently working on Alkemio in four different use cases! We sat down with Gerlof  to discuss the VNG renewal and some lessons learned from the past year.

First of all, we looked back at some **important lessons** from the last year. How did he grow the community, what is a good tip for others just starting their community on Alkemio?

*"The most important lesson I've learned is to take every opportunity"* mentioned Gerlof. *"To show what's being shared in this Space on Alkemio, how to find it and how to get involved. You can't do that often enough. I now have an instruction video and I notice that it has an effect. The number of users familiar with the Totaal Driedimensionaal Space are slowly increasing. Potential active participants must come from that group. So, the larger the group, the greater the chance.* 

With this growing number of participants, what is the **vision in the coming year** for the T3D Space on Alkemio? Who will be active, what will the activities be, or what is the key goal?

"*Currently, the active users are mainly municipalities and other organizations outside the T3D programme. They now mainly use the platform to learn about the results of the programme. Now that the program has been completed, I want to continue to encourage cooperation and knowledge sharing on this subject on this platform, at least within the municipal domain.*"

A final question: what do you need to further **grow your community** or what do you want to **ask the Alkemio community**? For his 'Totaal Driedimensionaal' community the "*key participants are the municipalities themselves*". But there is also another valuable callout to all of you. "*In addition, it would help me / us to share insights and knowledge around real life examples of community collaboration on Alkemio (around other topics). Successful approaches and what we can learn from them.*"

And he is right... we can learn so much from each other. So let's continue to share our experiences! Have a look at our [Forum](https://alkem.io/forum) and start interacting with other users of the platform.

Thank you Gerlof for sharing your journey!
