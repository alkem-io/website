New functionality is continously added to Alkemio. A big step forward was taken recently when we launched Canvases.

## What is a Canvas?
A Canvas on the Alkemio platform is essentially a whiteboard whereby users can **create and collaborate visually**. It is similar to well known tools such as Miro, but adapted to support the flows needed for Alkemio users. 

The data for Canvases in Alkemio is stored within the platform and managed within the context of a Challenge or Hub. It does not reside on the servers of yet another service. The data is yours and you can download it / use it elsewhere.

Canvases can be either blank sheets to be filled in, or they can be created using a **Canvas Template**. A Canvas Template is an existing Canvas that can be used as a base for further work. Canvas Templates can be made available at the Hub or Challenge level. When a Canvas Template is made available at the Hub level, they are automatically available to all Challenges within that Hub.
## What can I do with them?
Canvases are a great way to **share best practices**, for example on how to brainstorm around your potential business model, creating a storyboard or describing your key customers. Instead of searching for ways to do so, you can choose one of the available Templates and start immediately. 

Furthermore, they can **provide the core material** that should be used by people working on Challenges within a particular context. Let's show you three examples!

First, the Template below can be used to *create personas*. It allows you to define the most important characteristics of key stakeholders.

Second, the following Template can help you brainstorm about the core elements of a business model. As you can see, the Template can also *include useful icons* for such a process.

Third, you can also *add guidelines* on how to use the Template as shown in this example of the Triple Diamond Model.

You can find some more Canvases in the following [Challenge](https://hub.alkem.io/open-innovation/challenges/canvas-templates/canvases) where we will be sharing additional Template examples.

## How are Canvases implemented in Alkemio?
Alkemio is committed to Open Source. So we were very keen to also base core functionality like Canvases on open source components. 

The Canvases in Alkemio are built on top of the [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw) component. 

You can see many more examples of what can be done on that platform via their own online hosted environment (**tip**: browse their [libraries](https://libraries.excalidraw.com/?target=_excalidraw&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fexcalidraw.com%2F&useHash=true&token=RM8c2HaxtZ5dajcEvn9LU&theme=light&version=2&sort=new)). 

Kudos to the Excalidraw team for what they have created, and very much looking forward to helping them take their platform further.
## What is next?

To conclude, Canvases are a very powerful addition to the Alkemio platform, which we will develop further in the coming months. For now please [sign up](https://hub.alkem.io/identity/registration) and explore. 

We are looking forward to seeing what Templates are created and shared!
