New functionality is being continually added to Alkemio. A big step forward was taken recently when we launched Canvases. You can see some example [Canvases at the following Challenge](https://hub.alkem.io/open-innovation/challenges/canvas-templates/canvases) where we will be sharing additional templates. Please sign up and explore!

A Canvas in Alkemio is essentially a whiteboard whereby users can create and collaborate visually. Similar to well known tools such as Miro, but adapted to support the flows needed for Alkemio. 

Canvases are a great way to share **best practices**, and to make available core material that should be used by people working on Challenges within a particular context. These are called __templates__ in Alkemio - and Templates can be set at the Hub or Challenge level. If they are set at the Hub level then they are automatically available to all Challenges within that Hub. 

Critically the data for Canvases in Alkemio is stored within the platform, and is managed within the context of a Challenge / Hub. It does not reside on the servers of yet another service, the data is yours and you can download it / use it elsewhere. 

The Canvases in Alkemio are built on top of the [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) component, and you can see many more examples of what can be done on that platform via their [own online hosted environment](https://excalidraw.com/) (tip: browse their libraries). Kudos to the Excalidraw team for what they have created, and very much looking forward to helping them take their platform further. 

Canvases are a very powerful addition to the Alkemio platform, which we will be building further on in the coming months. For now please explore, we are looking forward to seeing what templates are created and shared!
