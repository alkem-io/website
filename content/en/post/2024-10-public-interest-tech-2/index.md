## Ownership and Governance of Tech Companies

As the public interest tech movement continues to grow, innovators are delving into new models for ownership and governance of the technologies that shape our lives.

Unlike #govtech, which focuses primarily on government-related technologies, public interest tech encompasses all technologies impacting society. This broader scope highlights a significant role for private sector companies. Balancing public interests with the private sector’s entrepreneurial spirit and agility is crucial, albeit challenging.

### Traditional Ownership Models

Historically, technology initiatives have been driven by either the public or private sector. However, each approach has its shortcomings:

- **Public Sector**: Pure public sector tech initiatives often struggle to achieve the necessary scale or deliver a quality user experience.
- **Private Sector**: Large tech companies dominate the landscape, providing much of the technology used by the public sector. These companies prioritize shareholder profits over public interests.

### Emerging Governance Models

As technology's societal role expands, more tech companies are aligning private sector power with public and societal interests. Notable examples include:

- **Alkemio**: Embraces steward-ownership, combining foundation ownership with a third-party veto right to legally secure its mission — unlike OpenAI.
- **Mozilla**: Owned exclusively by a foundation, ensuring its commitment to public interest.
- **Anthropic**: Operates as a Public Benefit Corporation, prioritizing societal benefits alongside profits.

### Key Considerations for Ownership and Governance

To effectively align tech companies with public interests, the following principles are essential:

#### Forever Purpose Companies

- **Long-term Commitment**: Legally secure the company's mission to prevent management from altering its purpose.
- **Steward-Ownership**: Utilize structures like a third-party holding a veto share to maintain mission integrity.
- **Limitations of Current Models**: While "B Corp" status is well-intentioned, it allows shareholders to change the company's purpose or sell to big tech, making the mission vulnerable over time.

#### Benefiting All Stakeholders

- **Inclusive Decision-Making**: Ensure that decisions serve the company's purpose and benefit all stakeholders, not just capital providers.
- **Stewardship**: Implement boards or stewards committed to acting in the collective interest.

#### Openness and Transparency

- **Open Source**: Develop open-source technologies to allow public scrutiny and foster trust.
- **Diverse Stakeholder Engagement**: Remain receptive to diverse perspectives to ensure technologies serve broad societal needs.

### Challenges and Community Engagement

Adopting alternative ownership and governance models is not straightforward, particularly for tech companies. Sharing successful examples and fostering dialogue can help pave the way for more organizations to follow suit. There is likely no one-size-fits-all solution, and community input is invaluable.
