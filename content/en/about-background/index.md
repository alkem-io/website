        **Alkemio** is a new open innovation platform, building a better future together. Open source, a shared platform and community. Everyone can contribute so that everyone can benefit.
        
        Alkemio is supported by a **purpose driven, neutral foundation** to develop the platform, and to grow  a community around it. Together we can create a digital open source public infrastructure whereby our shared challenges are central. Our <a href="https://alkemio.org/manifesto/">Manifesto</a> shines a light on the key principles of our purpose-driven Alkemio Foundation. It gathers insights into public values, where the platform is built on. Make sure to read it and support us in making this vision a reality by joining our network.
