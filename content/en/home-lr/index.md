        **How?**

        There is a world of innovation and collaboration best practices, templates, and insights available. But how do we find them? And more importantly, how can we directly apply them?

        The Best Practises Library enables everyone to share and directly deploy best practices for effective collaboration. Choose an 'Innovation Pack' to start. Deploy a guided innovation flow, with clear steps, whiteboard and post templates to get your collaboration going.
