# Persona Perspectives

### Hello new user! In this page we want to help you find out how can you use the platform at the best of its capacities depending on who you are and what value you can  get from the Alkemio community. 

First follow our "new member" [getting started](../getting-started) guide and begin your journey!

#### Persona 1: Innovation Manager 
Are you an **Innovation Manager** within an organization, from for example UWV or Digicampus, and you want to involve all employees from your innovation initiatives or programmes? Your challenge is a place where you can engage directly with the community. and other community members. You can create posts or engage make call outs and comment on existing challenges. To set up your Space you can contact the Alkemio team and get your issue on the platform and start involving your colleagues, co-workers, and likeminded that could contribute to solving the issue through sharing knowledge, stories, and useful case studies to learn from. 

#### Persona 2: Community/Organization Member
Are you part of a Space or Challenge (an Alkemio community) with individuals from different organizations that work on a shared challenge, for example the energy transition? You can search, browse, or ask to join the relevant Spaces or create a new one. You can follow up on the challenges with other individuals that have your same interests in solving issues related to energy transition and add your challenge and invite your community in it. This way everyone could get involved in a big and united community that can help each other by sharing content on the same issue they are all interested in, giving different perspectives, suggestions, and so on. Membership: Each Space has members that are contributing. You can become a member via the Space page.
Visibility: Most Spaces are public and hence fully visible to everyone. For private Spaces, the content is only available after becoming a member.

#### Persona 3: Individual
Are you an Individual that was invited to join a Space on a particular set of challenges? You can gain valuable insights from subject matter experts and contribute to that challenge by sharing your own knowledge and experiences to help others. You can give your opinion, suggestion, and curiosities on the challenge by creating a 'Call-out' or comment on the specific challenge within the platform. As an individual you can also search or browse other challenges and Spaces to get inspiration for further improvement of the platform itself, maybe in order to help you out on another issue you may want to raise yourself. You can contact other community members to forge new relationships and learn from one another.
