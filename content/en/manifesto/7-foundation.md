Alkemio is the platform launched and operated by our purpose-driven team of professionals. We believe that:
</p>
<li align="center">
We need a <b>digital platform to support working together on challenges</b>. To achieve systematic change in how we work together on challenges requires inclusion and transparency.
</li>
<li align="center">
By <b>working together</b> with our users, partners, businesses, researchers, and citizens every day we reveal <b>the infinite potential of collaboration</b>. This is the key to success.
</li>
<li align="center">
<b>Public values should be central</b>. We love tech, but not how it is often used. We do not want data and digital tools to exploit people. Interactions should benefit public values, rather than commercial or other interests.
</li>
<li align="center">
<b>We enable change</b>. We put our energy and capabilities into building a solid <b>open-source platform</b>, best practices and trusted partnerships to innovate, develop, collaborate and <b>make progress together</b>. 
</li>

<i>Alkemio is empowering society to succeed in working on challenges, together.</i> </p>
<p align="center">We invite all who support this mission to join the Alkemio community.
