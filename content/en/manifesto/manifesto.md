<H3  align="center">Alkemio Foundation principles</h3>
</p>
<p>
Alkemio is the platform founded and operated by our purpose-driven team of professionals. We believe that:
</p>
<p align="center">
- <b>We need a digital platform to support working together on challenges</b>: To achieve systematic change in how we work together on challenges requires inclusion and transparency.
</p>
<p align="center">
- <b>By working together</b> with our users, partners, businesses, researchers, and citizens that every day <i>we reveal the infinite potential of collaboration</i>. This is the key to success.
</p>
<p align="center">
- <b>Public values should be central</b>: We love tech. But not how tech is often used. We donâ€™t want data and digital tools to exploit people. Interactions should benefit public values, rather than commercial or other interests. 
</p>
<p align="center">
- <b>We enable change</b>.  We put our energy and capabilities into building <i>a solid open-source</i> platform and trusted partnerships to innovate, develop, collaborate and <i>make progress together</i>. 
</p>
<p align="center">
</p>
<p align="center">
We are open, give you our beliefs and successes, and invite all who support the principles of this manifesto <i>to join the community</i>. 
</p>
