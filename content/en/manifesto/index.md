        Alkemio is the platform launched by a purpose-driven team of professionals. By <b>working together</b> with  users, partners, businesses, researchers, and citizens we believe that: 

        - Every day we can reveal the <b>infinite potential of collaboration</b>. This is the key to success.
        - To achieve <b>systematic change</b> in how we work together on <b>challenges</b> requires inclusion and transparency. Enabled by an <b>independent digital platform</b> to support this way of <b>working together on challenges</b>.
        - Public values should be central</b>. We love tech. But not how it is often used. We do not want digital tools and data to be used to exploit people. They should benefit society.
        - <b>We enable change</b>. We put our energy and capabilities into building a solid <b>open-source platform</b>, best practices and trusted partnerships to innovate, develop, collaborate and <b>make progress together</b>. 

        <i>Alkemio is empowering society to succeed in working on challenges, together.</i>
        <br/>
        We invite all who support this mission to join the Alkemio community!
