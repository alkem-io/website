    <p>At Alkemio, challenges are central, with a community around the challenge. The community will be given the opportunity to contribute and work towards this via feasible steps. Such challenges are not the starting point at RIConline. This platform focuses on community formation in a broad sense and allows users to determine for themselves, bottom-up, which themes, problems and challenges related to innovation they want to work on. </p>
