    <p>The key is alignment: “where” do we want to go? Alignment is critical for 
collaboration of any sort. Especially as collaboration crosses organizational 
boundaries. And the issues facing our society, large and small, cannot be 
solved by people or organizations working alone. </p>
    <p>Teams/Slack/Google Workspace/Whatsapp etc. are all great for interacting and 
producing - but they do not put the change central. And having a clear shared 
understanding of the change is critical. Read more about this in our <a

    <p> We believe that we can succeed in working on challenges, together. That is 
why Alkemio is an open source platform, to benefit everyone. Generally, Open 
Source software is software that can be freely accessed, used, changed, and 
shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open source software is 
made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the Open 
Source Definition. The license used by Alkemio is the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Public_Licence" target="_blank">EU-PL license</a>.
</p>
<p>
Alkemio is proud to be contributing as a practical example of how to do <a 
href="https://www.alkemio.foundation/post/2021-07-open-source-pleio"> open 
source</a> in a societal innovation context. Perhaps more importantly we are 
also keen to share our learnings on the challenges and barriers faced in our 
journey.

    <p>Alkemio comes from the idea that to create something good that also works there is a need of mixed elements. Our new name reflects that solving complex challenges needs a mix of knowledge, collaboration, creativity, dedication and some magic. Alkemio started from an idea and some core values attached to it. The idea was to create an innovative web space where people can interact and cooperate on things they share interests in. The core values and purpose are explained in the Foundation page, but the sense of community is a core one. After consultign that page you will understand what do we stand for and what we want to achieve. </p>
