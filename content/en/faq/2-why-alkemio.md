    <p>The key is alignment: “where” do we want to go? Alignment is critical for collaboration of any sort. Especially as collaboration crosses organizational boundaries. And the issues facing our society, large and small, cannot be solved by people or organizations working alone. </p>
    <p>Teams/slack/Google Workspac/Whatsapp etc. are all great for interacting and producing - but they do not put the change central. And having a clear shared understanding of the change is critical. Read more about this in our <a href="https://draft.alkem.io/post/2022-01-why-do-we-need/" target="_blank"> blogpost</a>.</p>

    <p> We believe that we can succeed in working on challenges, together. That is why Alkemio is an open source platform, to benefit everyone. Generally, Open Source software is software that can be freely accessed, used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open source software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition. The internationally recognized Open Source Definition provides ten criteria that must be met for any software license, and the software distributed under that license, to be labeled "Open Source software." Alkemio is proud to be contributing as a practical example of how to <a href="https://www.alkemio.foundation/post/2021-07-open-source-pleio">do open source</a> in a societal innovation context. Perhaps more importantly we are also keen to share our learnings on the challenges and barriers faced in our journey.
