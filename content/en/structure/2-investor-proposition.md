Alkemio is raising funds to accelerate the journey. 

Investment in Alkemio offers three types of returns: 
* **Economic returns**: capped economic returns, a multiple of the capital invested
* **Social returns**: Alkemio has the potential to really impact our society. On a massive scale. It is hard to over state the potential: much more effective progress on key challenges, collaboration on digital platforms that put societal values first, avoiding duplication of efforts, more inclusity and engagement across society. 
* **Inspiration returns**: our society is increasingly digital, and the digital platforms are dominated by parties whose interests do not align with societies interests. This status quo is not a given, and Alkemio is aiming to inspire many more people and organizations to work towards a future where digitalization works for society!

Important to note that the normal rules of a VC funded startup do not apply when it comes to rasing funds: there is no cap table of control to protect. As such the more capital Alkemio can raise the faster we can realize the vision. 

Alkemio is looking to build a wider community of backers, people or organizations that wish to *do well and do good*. 

It is an ambitious vision, and one we believe is both very achievable and worthwhie. Join us!
