<b>Release 2022-8-22</b>
<p></p>
<i>Over the summer months, we have made some big changes to the platform lay-out and functionalities! Mainly as part of our aim to simplify the platform and increase user engagement. These changes include:</i>

- The overall layout has changed, now placing the Hub title central, with the tagline underneath it. The banner images 
are are now centered too.  
- The platform menu has been moved to the top right, where you can find all the Challenges and Contributors. 
- The menu tabs on Hub, Challenge and Opportunity level are reduced from six to four:
    - The **Dashboard** tab has mostly remained the same, including a summary of the content.
    - The **Explore** tab becomes the place where all the wisdom of the community is gathered, either through 
Canavases or Aspects. On Hub, Challenge and Opportunity level, the leads can now ask their community to submit 
their Canvas or Aspect with a 'Callout'. 
    - The **Challenges** and **Opportunities** tabs have remained the same.
    - The **About** tab now contains all information from the former Context and Community tabs.
    - The **Admin section** can be reached through the cogwheel icon.
