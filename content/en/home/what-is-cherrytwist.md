**Alkemio** is a new open innovation platform, building a better future together. Open source, a shared platform and community. Everyone can contribute so that everyone can benefit.

Stichting Alkemio is a **not-for-profit, neutral entity** to develop the Alkemio platform, and to grow  a community around it. Together we can create a digital open source public infrastructure whereby our shared Challenges are central.
