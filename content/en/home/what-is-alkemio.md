# Why Alkemio?
Many challenges in our society and organizations arenâ€™t getting solved. Local and global challenges, and frustrations. People want to contribute in an effective and meaningful way - but how?

The **Alkemio platform** makes it easy to start a challenge so that contributors from anywhere can work together to solve it. Challenges take centre-stage; focus is on the destination.

Backed by a foundation to develop the Alkemio platform and community. Purpose driven.

Connect, collaborate and contribute.
