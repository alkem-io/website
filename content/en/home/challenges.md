A Challenge is a **dissatisfaction with current reality**, in the context of a bigger vision or goal, whereby multiple parties need to coordinate their activities over a longer period to address it. They are typically complex, and span multiple organisational boundaries â€“ and we already see that organisational boundaries are blurring, as the awareness that no one organisation can solve these challenges alone, is growing.
