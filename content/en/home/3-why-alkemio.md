  <h2 class="font-weight-bold" >Why Alkemio </h2>
  Many Challenges in society and organizations are hard to solve. From refugee crises to climate change to a digitalizing society to community initiatives. People want to engage in effective and meaningful ways - but how? <br> <br>

  **Alkemio** makes it easy to manage Challenges and have contributors, from anywhere, working together on solutions. Challenges take center-stage. Focus is on the destination.

  Backed by a foundation to develop the Alkemio platform and community of people, companies, NGOs and public bodies. Purpose driven, with a hugely ambitious agenda.
