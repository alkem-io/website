**Society faces complex challenges at all levels**. From cities and national governments working with their citizens to adapt to the opportunities offered by and implications  of rapid technical and societal change, through to global topics such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Companies need to re-invent themselves to remain relevant, citizens want to connect and contribute. 


**Society is complex.** In our hyper connected world, any change impacts many parties. The complexity of collaborating to address dissatisfaction with current reality, often referred to as Challenges, has long passed the point where any one person or organisation can solve them. We need to collaborate. 

{{< figure src="historical-progression.jpg" id="complexity-rising" caption="Complexity is rising" numbered="true">}}

**Societal change is accelerating.** The simple fact is that we are seeing an exponential rate of change and technological development. The impact is that new challenges are emerging faster than we can address them â€“ and this gap is growing. Trust in existing ways of working is eroding. Too many of our citizens feel disconnected from and not able to contribute to the future we are going towards. 


**Collaborating effectively on challenges is hard.** It is changing established ways of working, affecting identities, governance structures and norms built up over centuries. And our current platforms and tooling are optimized for a simpler and more hierarchical world.
