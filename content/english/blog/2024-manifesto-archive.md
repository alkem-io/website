## We cannot progress alone

Today, issues such as **refugee crises**, **fake news**, **online safety** and **climate change** are not being sufficiently solved. Society needs to get much better at addressing such **challenges**. Across all boundaries.

It is urgent as the **pace of change** is increasing.

## Across all boundaries

Alkemio is for **channelling** all the effort and ambition around challenges into solutions. Bringing people together, **sharing knowledge and ideas**, with a clear focus on the **opportunities**. Using **best practices**, the community around a challenge works together to identify next steps and **make progress**.

## Open for all

Everyone can contribute. Making it straightforward to find, follow and directly **add value** on challenges. You can easily engage, learn from or add to the collective **wisdom of the community**. Providing an **open source platform**, to benefit everyone.

## Empowering society

To succeed in working on challenges, **together**.

The Alkemio foundation and platform are launched by a purpose-driven team of professionals. By **working together** with users, partners, businesses, researchers, and citizens we believe that:

- Every day we can reveal the **infinite potential of collaboration**. This is the key to success.
- To achieve **systematic change** in how we work together on **challenges** requires inclusion and transparency. Enabled by an **independent digital platform** to support this way of **working together on challenges**.
- **Public values should be central**. We love tech. But not how it is often used. We do not want digital tools and data to be used to exploit people. They should benefit society.
- **We enable change**. We put our energy and capabilities into building a solid **open-source platform**, best practices and trusted partnerships to innovate, develop, collaborate and **make progress together**.

*Alkemio is empowering society to succeed in working on challenges, together.*

We invite all who support this mission to join the Alkemio community!
