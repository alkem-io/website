We are very pleased to announce the award of a 'Pioneers-grant' by the [SIDN fonds](https://www.sidnfonds.nl) for the development
of a [*'self-sovereign identity module'*](https://www.sidnfonds.nl/projecten/cherrytwist-self-sovereign-identity-module) for the platform.

The goal of this project is to strengthen the self-sovereign aspect of the platform, also by evaluating potential integration with existing solutions.
