  # subtitle: "About"
  description: 
    - paragraph: "From our base in The Hague, we are committed to helping change makers in The Netherlands and worldwide succeed in their collective action efforts. Alkemio's origin story is from one of the toughest crisis of the 21st century - the COVID-19 pandemic. Our founders were part of Dutch public-private initiative to collectively overcome shared challenges. We experienced how, despite the best intentions, the lack of a supportive digital infrastructure was constraining our collective action efforts. Our communities depended on disparate tools, ad-hoc solutions, and algorithms putting the interests of large technology companies first." 
    - paragraph: "We imagined a purpose-built alternative. With all the building blocks for excelling at collective action, and designed from first principles to put society's interests first. With technology as an enabler, we aimed to harness the human capacity, talent, and determination to solve societal challenges, and support their endeavours."
